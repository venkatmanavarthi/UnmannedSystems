# Unmanned Systems HW3

## Problem 1
Modify your Dijkstraâ€™s software to run the A* algorithm. This should require only small
modifications to the cost estimate for each cell. Rerun the same simulation environment as Problem
4 and show the x vs y graph. Put the image of the path in the document here
